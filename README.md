-- Supplementary Videos for NMII Filament Assembly Simulations --

This repository contains the supplementary videos accompanying the thesis on 'Understanding the Self-Assembly of Non-Muscle Myosin II: from Discrete Stochastic Dynamics to Spatial Simulations'.
Each video visualizes one of the stochastic simulation approaches used in the study, either the Gillespie-based algorithm (assembly pathway) or the kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation (diffusion-limited encounters).

The supplementary items are listed below:

S1: Visualization of NMII filament assembly generated by a Gillespie-based simulation for the ribbon model and D = 3 µm^2/s.
S2: Visualization of NMII filament assembly generated by a Gillespie-based simulation for the subfilament model and D = 3 µm^2/s.
S3: Visualization of NMII filament assembly generated by a Gillespie-based simulation for the ribbon model and D = 0.2 µm^2/s.
S4: Visualization of NMII filament assembly generated by a Gillespie-based simulation for the ribbon model and D = 15 µm^2/s.
